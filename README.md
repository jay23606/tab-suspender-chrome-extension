## ⚡ Why Tab Suspender?

When The Great Suspender was removed from the Chrome Web Store for containing malware, millions of users were left without a reliable tab suspension tool. Many "replacements" appeared, but few were open source, and even fewer were built on modern Manifest V3.

**Tab Suspender** is the open source Great Suspender alternative you've been looking for. Built from the ground up with Chrome's latest Manifest V3 architecture, it automatically suspends inactive tabs to free up memory — without compromising your privacy or security.

Unlike closed-source alternatives, every line of code is right here for you to inspect. No hidden trackers. No data collection. No malware. Just a clean, efficient tab suspender that does exactly what it promises.

## ✨ Features

- **Auto-Suspend Inactive Tabs** — Automatically suspends tabs after a configurable period of inactivity (5 minutes to 24 hours), freeing up RAM and CPU resources
- **Instant Tab Restoration** — Click any suspended tab or press any key to instantly restore it to its original state
- **Smart Domain Whitelist** — Protect important sites like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs from ever being suspended, with an easy-to-manage whitelist
- **Audio Tab Protection** — Tabs playing music or video are never suspended, so your Spotify, YouTube, and podcast streams stay uninterrupted
- **Unsaved Form Protection** — Keeps tabs with detected unsaved text, checkbox, or dropdown edits from being suspended by the background. Enabled by default; detection is best-effort, and direct popup actions may bypass this protection.
- **Pinned Tab Protection** — Pinned tabs are never suspended by default, keeping your most important tabs always ready
- **Active Tab Protection** — The tab you're currently viewing is never suspended
- **Suspend & Restore All** — One-click buttons to suspend all inactive tabs at once or restore all suspended tabs simultaneously
- **Memory Savings Dashboard** — Track how much memory you've saved today and over time with a detailed statistics dashboard and historical charts
- **Tab Search & Filtering** — Quickly find any tab by title or URL, and filter by status (active, idle, suspended)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — Power-user shortcuts for fast tab management:
  - `Alt+S` — Suspend current tab
  - `Alt+Shift+S` — Suspend all other tabs
  - `Alt+R` — Restore all tabs
  - `Alt+W` — Whitelist current site
- **Context Menu Integration** — Right-click any page to suspend, restore, or whitelist directly from the context menu
- **Settings Import/Export** — Back up and restore your configuration across devices with JSON import/export
- **Beautiful Suspended Tab Page** — Suspended tabs display the original favicon, page title, memory saved, and time suspended with a clean, branded design
- **Badge Counter** — See the number of currently suspended tabs right on the extension icon
- **Onboarding Flow** — Guided setup for new users with interactive demo and quick configuration
